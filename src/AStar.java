	 * A* Algorithm
	 *
	 * Description:
	 * 	
	 * 	f(n) = g(n) + h(n)
	 *
	 * 	n: Next node 
	 * 	g(n): Distance from start node to next node 
	 *	h(n): Heuristic based distance from next node the destination node 
	 *
	 *	Goal is to minimize f(n)
	 * 
	 * Context: 
	 * 	1. Is a search algorithm. 
	 * 	2. Is a variation of Dijkstra's Algorithm.
	 * 	3. Is a Greedy algorithm.
